# Souspli

**Signed, self-contained letters that people send each other and keep — instead of
pages a server renders for them.**

A Souspli letter is one file. It carries its own content, images, layout and
behaviour, and its author's signature covers all of it. It opens in a sealed
container with no network, so it can be as interactive as a web page and still
cannot report on its reader. Hand it on by any channel — a file, a paste, a torrent,
a relay — and whoever receives it verifies it without asking anyone.

Out of that one object: articles, invitations, invoices, contracts with several
signatures, clubs with rosters, forums with threads, votes and moderation. No
accounts, no host, nothing to shut down.

> **Experimental alpha.** It works and it is tested hard. It has not been
> independently reviewed, builds are unsigned, and private (sealed) letters cannot
> yet be written from the app. [The plain list](docs/use/status.md).

*sous pli* — French, "under sealed cover".

## Try it

Download an installer from [Releases](https://github.com/souspli/souspli/releases),
or build it:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Needs Node 22, pnpm and a C++ toolchain. [Build notes](docs/how/develop/building.md),
including the Linux sandbox note for containers and CI.

The fastest way to see what it is *for*:

```bash
pnpm world provision && pnpm world seed
pnpm world forum        # one forum, ranked differently for two readers — by whom each trusts
pnpm world open ada     # the real app, on a populated library
```

## What is in this repository

| Path | |
|---|---|
| `src/format/` | The letter format: canonical CBOR, hashing, signing, sealing, admission. Pure TypeScript; no Electron, no network, holds no keys. |
| `src/conformance/` | 41 portable test vectors so a second implementation can prove it agrees. |
| `src/main/`, `src/preload/` | The sealed container ("the cage"). Imports nothing from the rest — enforced in CI. |
| `src/shell/` | The desktop client ("the shell"): admission, keyring, library, transports, relays, trusted header. |
| `samples/` | The fifteen built-in types, one HTML file each. |
| `test/` | The escape battery, ~270 end-to-end tests against the real app, ~190 unit tests. |
| `docs/` | Everything above. [`docs/design-notes/`](docs/design-notes/index.md) keeps the original build briefs as decision records. |

The code calls a letter a *thing*, a type a *program*, and the client the *shell* —
[glossary](docs/glossary.md). Nothing on the wire was renamed.

// @souspli/conformance — the format half of the interop suite.
//
// The committed ./vectors/*.json are the language-agnostic artifact: a second
// implementation proves interop by running exactly these against its own code.
// In TypeScript, implement `ConformanceTarget` and call `runAll`; in any other
// language, consume the JSON directly (its schema is documented in README.md).
//
// The CAGE half of conformance — the hardened escape suite that proves an
// untrusted thing cannot break out of the renderer — is inherently host-specific
// (Electron) and lives as the Playwright `test/shell/*.spec.ts` battery, indexed
// in README.md. It is not reducible to portable data the way the format is.

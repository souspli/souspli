// This file no longer implements a Transport. `Transport.fetch()` is
// Promise<bytes>, which cannot express progress, cancellation, or a download
// that outlives the request -- so magnets are handled by TorrentService
// (src/shell/torrent) as long-lived TRANSFERS, and never reach the transport
// dispatch. What remains here is the lazy loader, the shape of the library, and
// the discovery switch.

// These are OUR declarations for a module imported dynamically, which means
// they are an assertion, not a check: if webtorrent's API moves, tsc keeps
// agreeing with whatever is written here. `getBuffer` sat here long after
// webtorrent 3.x replaced it with `arrayBuffer`, and the only symptom was a
// magnet fetch that timed out as though no peer had answered. When touching
// these, read the installed lib/file.js rather than trusting the shape below.

 *
 *  It exists for the tests. What they check about seeding is OURS: that a
 *  magnet is produced, that the intent survives a restart with the same
 *  infohash, that stopping stops, and that deleting a thing stops serving it.
 *  None of that needs a swarm -- but a default client bootstraps the DHT and
 *  announces to public trackers before it will do anything, which on a CI
 *  runner is slow when it works and a timeout when it does not. Those tests had
 *  been given 90 and 120 second budgets to absorb it and still failed
 *  intermittently on all three platforms, which is a test depending on the
 *  weather rather than on the code.
 *
 *  Deliberately NOT the default: a shell that cannot find peers cannot share,
 *  and the real path is exercised by `pnpm world magnet`, which runs two real
 *  instances and moves bytes between them. */

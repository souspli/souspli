// Test-observable event log.
//
// Everything the cage blocks or forwards is recorded here, in the MAIN process,
// OUTSIDE the untrusted renderer. The escape-attempt suite reads this via
// Playwright's `electronApp.evaluate(() => globalThis.__cage.events)`, so egress
// and escalation are verified from outside the sandbox — not by trusting the
// page's own error callbacks. See test/cage.spec.ts.
//
// `record()` survives into the real shell (it is called from the request
// canceller and the emit handler, both reachable in a loop by a thing), so it
// must be bounded. The log is a ring buffer; emit records store size + a short
// hash, NEVER the payload, so a flood of ≤256 KB messages cannot grow
// main-process memory without bound (finding P0-3).

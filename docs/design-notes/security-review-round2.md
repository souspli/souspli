# Security review round 2 — resolution

This records how the carried-over review findings were resolved on the
`phase-2-bridge` branch. Sources: `CAGE_REMEDIATION.md` (round 1) and
`CAGE_REVIEW_ROUND2.md` (round 2, authoritative where they conflict), plus the
line-level PR-review checklist in `CODE_SESSION_HANDOFF.md`.

Guiding principle throughout: **a green suite and an accurate-sounding
description do not distinguish "the guarantee holds" from "the test passes for
the wrong reason."** Several fixes here are "make the assertion observe
something real," and each new test was checked for the false-pass class it could
belong to.

**Status:** all findings addressed except N6 (deliberately kept as the geometry
assertion — see below). Suite: **39 Playwright + 46 unit, green**; both
typecheck projects clean. The green-wall banner now states the OS-sandbox status
(`OS SANDBOX: OFF — Layer 1 not exercised; --no-sandbox` under Playwright).

---

## P0 — harness integrity

### P0-1 — OS-sandbox honesty (`8b…`/`7e1babb`)
The suite ran with the OS sandbox **off** (Playwright's `_electron.launch`
injects `--no-sandbox` by default) while the banner printed an unqualified
`CAGE HOLDS`. Fixed so the wall can never overstate what was proven:
- The app records ground truth at startup as a `sandbox-state` event, detecting
  `--no-sandbox` via **both** `process.argv` and `app.commandLine.hasSwitch`.
  `process.argv` alone gave a false "ON" — the honest failure direction is to
  report OFF, so both signals are OR'd.
- `test/helpers.ts` scrubs `ELECTRON_DISABLE_SANDBOX` from the child env so it
  cannot be inherited from a shell/CI and silently weaken Layer 1.
- A `harness integrity` test reads the recorded state and **fails** a
  `--no-sandbox` run unless `CAGE_ALLOW_NO_SANDBOX=1` acknowledges it (set by
  `pnpm test:cage`). The reporter prints the status in the banner.
- `test/unit/hardening.test.ts` statically asserts every `webPreferences`
  Layer 1 flag and that the partition is non-persistent — the only guard against
  a refactor dropping `sandbox: true`, since every behavioral test passes with
  it off.
- README and the `helpers.ts` comment corrected to match reality.

### P0-3 — unbounded event log (`7e1babb`)
`record()` survives into the real shell and was an unbounded memory sink.
- `cage.events` is now a ring buffer (cap 2000) with a `dropped` counter.
- `emit` records store `channel + bytes + hash`, **never the payload**.
- The stderr mirror is capped (500 lines) and silent under `CAGE_QUIET=1`.
- Payloads needed for assertions moved to a separate, gated
  (`CAGE_TEST_CAPTURE=1`), bounded (count + per-entry bytes) **test-only**
  capture buffer.
- Flood tests rewritten to assert *boundedness*: a large-payload flood proves
  payloads are not retained (≈40 MB emitted, log stays tiny); an emit-count
  flood proves eviction deterministically (`dropped > 0`); a blocked-request
  flood proves the canceller path stays bounded and silent. Ring-buffer math is
  also unit-tested (`test/unit/events.test.ts`).

### P0-2 → P2 — WebRTC switches (`7e1babb`)
Round 1's "delete the switch" was wrong (round 2 corrected it). Both switches
kept; the comment now names each one's real effect —
`force-webrtc-ip-handling-policy` is the load-bearing control,
`disable-features=WebRtcHideLocalIpsWithMdns` is a companion that makes a
hypothetical breach *more* visible, not a disabler.

---

## P1 — decorative tests made load-bearing

### P1-4 — `net-thing-unknown` (`7e1babb`)
Both original vectors were hollow (a `supportFetchAPI:false` fetch and an image
to host `main`, which is a hostname miss). Now the index.html-route vector uses
the thing's **own** id with an unsupplied path, and a new cross-id test hands one
session another session's real id and proves it still 404s (per-session
registration).

### P1-5 / PR-review 1.1 — `parseThingUrl` traversal (`7e1babb`)
The old test asserted a fact about the WHATWG URL parser, leaving the
`path.includes('..')` guard dead code. New unit tests reject percent-encoded
traversal (`%2e%2e%2f`) that survives normalisation — removing the guard now
fails a test — and pin `att/` name decoding so the admitted **table**, not string
shape, is the gate.

### P1-6 — same-run storage race (`96bed84`)
The reader could pass because nothing had been written yet. The secondary cage
now mounts only after the primary's `write-done` emit (env-gated
`CAGE_AWAIT_PRIMARY_EMIT`), so a null read means "isolated". The race-free
launch-separated test is unchanged.

---

## New attacks (round 2)

### N1 (P1) — iframe / srcdoc (`fa78a68`)
`escalate-iframe.html` proves `frame-src 'none'` blocks `<iframe src=thing://>`
(observed via a `securitypolicyviolation`), and that a `srcdoc` child — the
historically-inconsistent case — has no `window.bridge`, no `require`, and a
silent canary fetch if it materialises at all. The child reports via
`postMessage`; the canary is the out-of-process witness.

### N2 (P1) — DNS / speculative connection (`fa78a68`)
`net-dns-prefetch.html` fires `dns-prefetch`, `preconnect`, `fetch`, and `img`
at an attacker **hostname**. The test maps that hostname straight at the canary
via `host-resolver-rules`, so any socket that leaked past the dead proxy /
`connect-src` would land on the canary. Nothing did. The canary also now decodes
DNS question names (`parseDnsQuestionName`) so a DNS datagram would be witnessed
by name.
- **Result:** no finding. The dead proxy + `connect-src` close the
  CSP-ungoverned speculative channels for hostname targets.
- **Residual (documented):** routing a *real* DNS datagram to an external
  resolver-shaped canary would need resolver reconfiguration this container does
  not allow. In the shipped config that channel is blocked by the dead-proxy
  delegation; the name-decoding canary is the regression witness if that ever
  changes.

### N3 (P2) — default-session egress (`fa78a68`)
The trusted chrome session's hardening had zero coverage. The test drives the
chrome `webContents` to fetch the canary and asserts it targeted the real canary,
did not resolve, and stayed silent — the default session blocks remote origins
even from trusted chrome.

### N4 (P2) — `data:` as a document (`fa78a68`)
A `data:` image resolves as a subresource (allowed), but `window.open` /
`location.assign` to a `data:text/html` document cannot become a document.
- **Note surfaced by the test:** top-level `data:` navigation is blocked by
  **Chromium itself**, before `will-navigate` fires — so there is (correctly) no
  `navigation-blocked` event for that vector. The test pins the *outcome*
  (stayed on `thing://`, `window.open` denied) rather than a mechanism; our
  `will-navigate` handler is defense in depth.

---

## P3 / lifecycle

### N5 / P3-10 / P3-11 (`7e1babb`)
`createCage` is now async and **awaits** `setProxy` (the layer whose job is
catching bypasses of the other layers must be installed before load).
`unbindCage` is wired to the `webContents` `destroyed` event, and the ephemeral
sealed store is cleared on teardown so decrypted plaintext does not outlive the
cage.

### N6 (P3) — chrome-spoof pixels — **kept as geometry assertion**
Reviewed and **deliberately left as-is.** The guarantee is architectural (the
chrome strip is a separate native `WebContentsView` sibling the thing has no
handle to), the review itself rated a pixel screenshot low priority, and the
geometry assertion is a cheap secondary check. A pixel-level screenshot via
`capturePage()` remains an option if desired later.

## PR-review checklist (CODE_SESSION_HANDOFF Part 1)

| Item | Outcome |
|---|---|
| 1.1 `att/` name validation | Verified in code; the table + hex-validated hash is the gate, thing input never reaches the filesystem. Unit-tested (P1-5). |
| 1.2 Range parser | Verified; parser unit tests + **response-level** tests asserting `Content-Range`, `Content-Length`, byte slice, 416, 404 (`0c4d1d2`). |
| 1.3 Sealed off disk | Strengthened: scans the CAS **and** Electron's userData tree for a magic marker, with a public-render control proving the scanner is not vacuous (`96bed84`). |
| 1.4 `getArgs` withholds envelope | Verified: test asserts the exact key set `{type, args, attachments}` and attachment rows carry only `{name, mime, size}` (no hash). |
| 1.5 `viewerInfo` coarse | Verified: test asserts the exact key set `{locale, colorScheme}`. |
| 1.6 `emit("publish")` caps | Verified: per-blob AND total-bytes AND count caps, all unit-tested; rejects record, grant nothing. |
| 1.7 Boundary hygiene | Verified: `protocol.ts` / `store.ts` / `cage.ts` import no bridge/draft/format code. |
| 1.8 Canary false-pass | Guarded: the image beacon reports the URL it targeted; the test asserts it was the real canary, so silence means "blocked", not "misfired" (`35c8638`). |

## Line-level review findings (this branch)

A fresh read of the diff surfaced one real defect and one accepted observation.

### R2-A (fixed) — unbounded draft retention
`handlePublish` pushed each accepted draft — **including its inline blob
bytes** — into `cageGlobals.drafts`, which was never bounded. A thing calling
`emit("publish", validDraft)` in a loop (each up to the 64 MB total-blob cap)
would grow main-process memory without limit. This is the P0-3 discipline that
round 2 explicitly said "applies to the draft path"; it had been applied to the
event log and the sealed store but missed here. **Fixed:** the drafts list now
retains bounded (ring of 64) **metadata only** — `{type, att, argsBytes,
blobBytes}`, never the raw bytes. A `bridge-publish-flood.html` regression test
sends 100 valid drafts and asserts the list stays ≤ 64 and holds no `blobs` key.

### R2-B (accepted, noted) — caps are enforced post-deserialization
Both `emit` paths measure and cap size *after* Electron has structured-cloned
the message into the main process, so an oversized payload is allocated before
it is rejected. The publish path (binary blobs) raises the transient ceiling
versus the generic path (JSON). The renderer is sandboxed with its own memory
limit, so the practical ceiling is bounded, and rejected payloads are freed
immediately — but a future hardening could measure total blob bytes in the
preload and refuse before the IPC send, keeping an oversized draft's blast
radius inside the sandboxed renderer. Noted for a later phase; not fixed here.

## What is genuinely good (for auditors)

Stated by round 2 and unchanged: five independent egress controls (scheme
registration + request canceller + CSP + dead proxy + per-contents WebRTC
policy); canary-verified-from-outside as the test philosophy; default-session
hardening that exceeds the brief; `Object.freeze` + exact-key-set surface tests;
`BaseWindow` + sibling `WebContentsView` for unspoofable chrome. None of the
findings were architectural — they were "make the tests observe what the
architecture already does."

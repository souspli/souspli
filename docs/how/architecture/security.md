# Security: threat model and evidence

This page says what Souspli claims, how each claim is tested, and what is *not*
covered. It is written to be argued with. To report a vulnerability, see
[SECURITY.md](../../../SECURITY.md).

## Status

The format and the container have been reviewed and adversarially tested **by their
authors**. There has been **no independent review** yet. Until there has, treat
every guarantee below as well-tested rather than proven, and do not rely on it for
anything that matters.

## Who is the adversary?

| Adversary | Can | Must not be able to |
|---|---|---|
| **A letter's author** — arbitrary hostile HTML/JS | run any code inside the container; draw anything in its rectangle | reach the network, persist anything, read files, learn who you are, see the envelope, forge or cover the header, sign anything as you |
| **Whoever delivers bytes** — a peer, a relay, a web server, a USB stick | send anything, at any rate, forever | get anything admitted that is not validly signed and hash-complete; crash or wedge the client; reach your key |
| **A relay** | see what you subscribe to and post; withhold or delay | make a letter appear to be by someone who did not sign it; make your machine fetch anything without a press |
| **A name resolver** | fail, or lie | attach a verified name to a key it does not provably map to |
| **Other readers** | hold and forward any letter they received, sealed or not | alter it, or read a sealed letter they were never sent |

**Out of scope:** malware already running as you on your machine (it can read your
files, including an identity stored in software mode); a compromised OS or Electron
build; traffic analysis of the transports you choose to use; and the *content* of a
letter being false. A signature proves who said something, never that it is so.

## The claims, and what tests them

### A letter cannot reach the network

Four independent layers ([container](container.md)). Tested by the **escape
battery**: `test/cage.spec.ts` drives one hostile page per attack from `test/things/`.
Each is handed — through the legitimate bridge — the address of a local **canary**
listening on TCP, HTTP, WebSocket and UDP, and tries to reach it: `fetch`, XHR,
WebSocket, EventSource, `sendBeacon`, image beacons, CSS exfiltration, injected
scripts, DNS prefetch, `data:` documents, WebRTC, iframes, navigation,
`window.open`, permission prompts, service workers and caches, another letter's
`thing://` id, and probing for Node or Electron globals. Further pages abuse the
bridge itself — floods, oversized and malformed drafts, the retired `publish`
channel, attempts to read the envelope.

The proof is taken **from outside the page**: the main-process event log and the
canary's own silence. A page's own error callbacks are secondary evidence only. The
run ends with one line per attack and `CAGE HOLDS n/n attempts blocked`.

### A letter cannot forge or cover the trusted header

The header is a separate native view. A geometry assertion in the escape battery,
plus a pixel-level test (`test/shell/chrome.spec.ts`): a letter that floods its
viewport and paints a fake "✓ signed" badge leaves the real badge intact and its own
colour absent from a capture of the header.

### A letter cannot persist or correlate

Each mount gets a fresh in-memory session partition. Tested by storage-bleed attacks
across mounts.

### Hostile bundles cannot compromise or wedge the client

Structural decoding happens in a disposable process with no keys, under hard limits
([admission](admission.md)). Tested: tar bombs, oversize input, non-canonical CBOR,
worker death and worker hang — the bundle is refused and the client carries on, key
intact. 41 [conformance vectors](../protocol/conformance.md) pin the accept/reject
boundary.

### Transports, relays and resolvers add reach, never authority

Verify-at-the-gate batteries: a transport returning garbage, tampered, oversize or
never-ending bytes; a relay event whose poster is not the author; an offer whose
fetched letter is validly signed but is not the one advertised; a resolver that
points a name at the wrong key. Plus the negative properties: nothing is *posted*
unasked, and nothing is *fetched* unasked.

### Private material stays off disk

The private key never appears on disk in plaintext; a sealed letter's decrypted
content is never written to disk. Both are tested by searching the profile directory
after the fact.

## The part we are careful not to overstate: the OS sandbox

Layer 1 includes Chromium's OS-level process sandbox — the backstop against a
renderer *memory-corruption* exploit. None of the behavioural guarantees above depend
on it, and the escape battery does not attempt memory corruption.

Playwright launches Electron with `--no-sandbox` by default, so the battery runs with
that layer **off**. Rather than let a green wall imply otherwise:

- the app records the *measured* sandbox state at startup;
- a `harness integrity` test reads it back and **fails** a no-sandbox run unless
  that is explicitly acknowledged;
- the banner prints it: `OS SANDBOX: OFF — Layer 1 not exercised; --no-sandbox`;
- a static test (`test/unit/hardening.test.ts`) guards every Layer 1 flag, because no
  behavioural test can catch a refactor that drops `sandbox: true` — they all pass
  with it off.

In a normal install on a normal desktop the OS sandbox is on. Details:
[design note](../../design-notes/sandbox.md).

## Principle for the test suite

> A green suite does not distinguish "the guarantee holds" from "the test passes for
> the wrong reason."

Several rounds of internal review were spent on exactly that: making assertions
observe something real, and checking each new test for the way it could pass
falsely. The record is in the [design notes](../../design-notes/security-review-round2.md).

## Known weaknesses

Stated in the [specification §10](../protocol/spec.md) and on the
[status page](../../use/status.md). The ones with security weight:

- **No key rotation or revocation.** A stolen key signs as you indefinitely.
- **Software key storage** where no OS keychain exists is obfuscation, not protection.
- **A seal is not access control.** Any recipient can forward a sealed letter.
- **Sealed attachments are linkable.** Two sealed copies of the same attachment share
  ciphertext.
- **`type` is untrusted** and exists anyway; any field that must not be trusted will
  eventually be trusted by someone.
- **Votes are signed without a confirmation dialog**, on the grounds that the control
  is in the trusted header. If a program could ever cause a vote to be cast, that is
  where it would break.
- **Ranking can fall back to forgeable raw counts** when you have vouched for nobody.
  The interface says so; any path where it does not is a bug.
- **Unsigned installers** until code-signing is in place.

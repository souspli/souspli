// Launch/close an Electron app N times and count abnormal exits.
//
//   node tools/probe-exit.mjs out/main/shell/main.js 60         # close during boot
//   WAIT_READY=1 node tools/probe-exit.mjs <target> 60          # close after ready
//   FIXED_DIR=world/accounts/ada node tools/probe-exit.mjs ...  # reuse a profile
//
// On headless Linux, run it under `xvfb-run -a`.
//
// Written to chase a crash that fails no test: the shell segfaults on roughly a
// third of closes that land DURING boot, and 0 of 60 when the close waits for
// ready. CI reaches it through launchShell's retry, which closes a still-booting
// app; it shows up as ~4% of app exits per suite run, on Linux and Windows but
// not macOS.
//
// What is already ruled out, so nobody repeats it: it is OURS, not Electron's.
// A bare app (60/60 clean), one holding an open better-sqlite3 handle (60/60),
// one using BaseWindow + WebContentsView like the shell's chrome (60/60), and
// one with a deliberately slow boot closed into the pause (25/25) were all
// clean. It is not first-run initialisation — an already-provisioned profile
// crashes at the same rate. Our JS quit path never runs (no quitReason is
// recorded), so the fault is native and precedes it, and guards added to the
// boot continuation did not change the rate.
//
// ROOT MECHANISM (found; supersedes the guesses below).
//
// The crash needs the close to land while main-process boot is ACTIVELY
// running. Closing while boot is PARKED at any point is clean -- 0/30 across
// four configurations, with the close aimed deterministically into a pause.
// And a bare Electron app whose boot stays busy crashes too (1/40), so the
// mechanism is Electron's, not ours; our boot is simply long enough to be hit
// ~30% of the time where the bare app is hit 2.5%.
//
// A WARNING for anyone bisecting this. Comparing configurations by "skip a
// component and see if the rate drops" is CONFOUNDED: skipping work makes boot
// shorter, which moves where a fixed-time close lands. That route produced
// confident, wrong answers here -- skipping the ENS client read as 0/80 vs
// 25/80, and skipping a webRequest hook as 1/60 vs 24/60, and BOTH effects
// vanished once the close was aimed at a fixed point in boot rather than a
// fixed wall-clock moment. Use WAIT_READY, or aim the close explicitly.
//
// Post-mortem analysis has been done, and hit a wall worth recording:
//
//   - Cores are ~845 MB apparent but SPARSE: ~40 MB each on disk. Capture with
//     `ulimit -c 6291456` from a scratch cwd (core_pattern is "core").
//   - Symbolise with `addr2line -f -C -e electron.debug <offset>`, NOT gdb --
//     gdb dies loading 1.3 GB of Chromium DWARF. Get symbols from the release's
//     electron-vX-linux-x64-debug.zip (361 MB) and CHECK THE BUILD ID matches
//     the shipped binary; ours did.
//   - The faulting PC resolves inside a dav1d DATA table, not a function, and
//     the stack words point there too. That is a wild indirect call -- a jump
//     through a freed or corrupted pointer -- which is also why no stack
//     unwinds. The core cannot name the caller.
//
// So it is a use-after-free reached by closing mid-boot, and post-mortem
// cannot go further. Naming the object needs a sanitiser build or rr, neither
// of which applies to a shipped Electron binary.
//
// The window-deferral idea recorded here earlier came from the same confounded
// comparison and is NOT supported: those numbers measured boot duration, not
// the window's presence.
//
// What did help is in the harness rather than the product: helpers.ts now waits
// for boot to settle before closing (closeSettled), since the suite only ever
// met this on the retry path, which by definition closes a still-booting app.
// That took a full suite run from 4 abnormal exits in 98 to 1, repeatably. The
// remaining one is an app that never becomes ready inside the grace period, so
// it is closed mid-boot regardless -- the unavoidable case.
